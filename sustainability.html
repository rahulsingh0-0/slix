          The use of biodegradable oils—whether they are synthetic or vegetable—is causing a
          significant change in the environment and signaling a safer substitute for the
          environment. Our lubricants are at the forefront of continuing advancements in lubricant
          innovation, distinguished by decreased flammability and lesser dangers to flora and fauna.
          In particular, advances in biodegradable lubricants—which also include hydraulic
          fluids—focus on increased biodegradability and reduced toxicity, which makes them ideal
          for use in activities that take place in ecologically sensitive places.

        <p style="line-height: 1.3" class="text-center">
          Even with these developments, there is still a serious problem with lubricant
          inappropriate disposal, which leads to an astounding 50% of lubricants used worldwide
          ending up in the environment. The main offenders that pollute vital ecosystems including
          fields, woods, and rivers are unintentional releases and spills. One solution that works
          well is to use biodegradable lubricants, which dissolve easily in water and soil and
          lessen their negative effects on the environment. Broadly speaking, companies that use
          biodegradable lubricants not only meet customer demands for sustainability, but also
          comply with environmental laws that require them to take responsibility for any damage
          done to water bodies, protected animals, or natural habitats.
